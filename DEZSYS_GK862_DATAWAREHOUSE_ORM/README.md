This lesson introduces the data accessing model in Spring and the basics of Object Relational Mapping (ORM).

## Introduction

This exercise is intended to demonstrate the interaction between a programming language (Java) and a persistance layer (MySQL, PostgreSQL).

First you should follow the Spring tutorial ["Accessing data with MySQL"](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql) and document all important steps in your protocol. Don't forget to make notes about all problems occured during the setup. Afterwards you should extend the data model of the example and adapt it for a Data Warehouse application (data structure see below). One relation between the entities Datawarehouse and Products is required in this example. Please read the documentation how you implementation entity relations using the ORM model.

Document all individual implementation steps and any problems that arise in a log (Markdown).  
Create a GITHUB repository for this project and add the link to it in the comments.

## Requirements

*   MySQL DMS
     *  Local MySQL Service   
     *  MySQL Docker Container
*   Gradle 8 or higher  
*   Java SDK 18 or higher  
     
## Data Structure - Data Warehouse
```
<warehouseData>
    <warehouseID>001</warehouseID>
    <warehouseName>Linz Bahnhof</warehouseName>
    <warehouseAddress>Bahnhofsstrasse 27/9</warehouseAddress>
    <warehousePostalCode>Linz</warehousePostalCode>
    <warehouseCity>Linz</warehouseCity>
    <warehouseCountry>Austria</warehouseCountry>
    <timestamp>2021-09-12 08:52:39.077</timestamp>
    <productData>
         <product>
             <productID>00-443175</productID>
             <productName>Bio Orangensaft Sonne</productName>
             <productCategory>Getraenk</productCategory>
             <productQuantity>2500</productQuantity>
             <productUnit>Packung 1L</productUnit>
         </product>
         <product>
             <productID>00-871895</productID>
             <productName>Bio Apfelsaft Gold</productName>
             <productCategory>Getraenk</productCategory>
             <productQuantity>3420</productQuantity>
             <productUnit>Packung 1L</productUnit>
         </product>
    </productData>
</warehouseData>
```
## Important Commands. 

*   Use gradle to build the application  
     `gradle clean`   
     `gradle bootRun`   

*   Connect to MySQL Shell  
     `mysqlsh <username>@localhost`   

*   MySQL Shell Commands  
     `show databases; // list all local databases `   
     `use example;  // switch to a local database "example" `   
     `show tables;           // list all of current database   `   
     `create table example;   // create a SQL table with the name "example"   `

## Questions

* What is ORM and how is JPA used?  
* What is the application.properties used for and where must it be stored?  
* Which annotations are frequently used for entity types? Which key points must be observed?   
* What methods do you need for CRUD operations?
